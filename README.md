# AnomalyDetectionSwat2019

# Description
Secure Water Treatment (SWaT), launched on 18 Mar 2015 by Chief Defense Scientist Prof. Quek Tong Boon, is a water treatment testbed for research in cyber security. There are currently seven versions of the Secure Water Treatment Dataset called A1 A2 (2015), A3 (2017), A4 A5 (2019), A6 (2019) and A77 (2019) (2020). The testbed serves as a key asset for researchers in Singapore and abroad who are aiming at the design of secure CPS. The project task is to visualize summaries of the data stream(s) and develop an ML model to detect anomalies in the data set. In this project work we will use SWaT2019.Which is consisted of 4 hours collected data from different sensors and actuators the dataset was collected from 39 actuators and 38 sensors distributed in all the stages of the test bed.
